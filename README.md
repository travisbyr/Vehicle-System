<h4>Objective</h4>

I created an application with the purpose of storing information about rental cars while making sure that I create an intuitive user interface. I was able to achieve this using C# and Windows Forms.  My application also uses a data source that stores and retrieves data when the application is closed and opened. Below is what the final product looks like.

<h4>MainForm</h4>

Here users can view, create and delete vehicles. By clicking a registration number on the side bar, users will receive a quick view of the vehicle information.
